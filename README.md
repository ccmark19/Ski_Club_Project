# Ski_Club_Project
This is my main practice project which designed for commercial purpose.<br>

I used ASP.NET core, SQL, a litte bit of Node.js for back-end,<br>
Javascript, boostrap, CSS, JSON, LINQ, npm for front-end development.<br>

If you download it, please change database and server name string which located in /appsettings<br>
Initialized sample data included two roles that is coach and user.<br>

Use the account below without register, and their password is the same which is qweQWE_123<br>
coach1@c.c<br> coach2@c.c<br> member1@m.m<br> member2@m.m<br>

As a coach you can add location and modify your own schedule that allow user to select to add on their appointment.
As a user you can view all coaches schedule and add the appointment in to your own appointment list.

  Manually typing numeric date might frustrating, I am building a calendar view for better UI/UX experience<br>
  Calendar view displayed, but the function still on construction.<br>

  New user after sign up can do add an appointment, but after they log out, they can not be login again for unsure reason.
